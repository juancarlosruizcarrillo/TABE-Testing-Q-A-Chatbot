        <p><strong>Face-to-Face Classes:</strong> Continuing students who do not need to test should not attend class on the first day.

Please inform these students that their first day of class will be after testing day. The first day of classes is reserved primarily for testing.</p>
        <p><strong>Online Classes:</strong> Teachers will receive a list of students, with those highlighted in blue indicating they do not need to test. Coordinate with the assessment team to schedule testing for those who need progress tests.</p>
