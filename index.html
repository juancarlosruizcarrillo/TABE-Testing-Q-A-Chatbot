            What do my continuing students do on the first day if they don’t have to test?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p><strong>Face-to-Face Classes:</strong> Continuing students who do not need to test should not attend class on the first day. Teachers will receive a list of students currently enrolled, with those highlighted in blue indicating they do not need to test. Please inform these students that their first day of class will be after testing day. The first day of classes is reserved primarily for testing.</p>
            <p><strong>Online Classes:</strong> Teachers will receive a list of students, with those highlighted in blue indicating they do not need to test. Coordinate with the assessment team to schedule testing for those who need progress tests.</p>

            What do I do if a student accidentally starts the wrong test?

            What happens if a student doesn’t finish their test on the first day?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>1. Tests should typically be completed within the scheduled three-hour class time. Ensure students are guided through instructions to avoid delays.</p>
            <p>2. If a test is incomplete, inform the assessment coordinator to schedule a follow-up session.</p>
            <p>3. While practice tests are optional and can reduce testing time, subject tests that are started should be completed in one session.</p>
            <p>4. For Reading & Language tests, sessions may be split across days, but they must be completed within the first 12 hours of attendance to establish an accurate Educational Functioning Level (EFL).</p>
